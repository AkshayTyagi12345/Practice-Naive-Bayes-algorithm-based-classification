Questions - 
Objective:•Practice Naive Bayes algorithm based classification.
•Identify the predictors that can be of influence by experiment.
Questions:

1.Load the kinematics dataset as measured on mobile sensors from the file “run_or_walk.csv”. List out the columns in the dataset.

2. Let the target variable ‘y’ be the activity and assign all the columns after it to ‘x’.

3.Using Scikit-learn fit a Gaussian Naive Bayes model and observe the accuracy.Generate a classification report using scikitlearn

4.Repeat the model once using only the acceleration values as predictors and then using only the gyro values as predictors. Comment on the difference in accuracy between both the models.
